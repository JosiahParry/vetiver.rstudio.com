The vetiver framework is for MLOps tasks in Python and R.

> *Vetiver, the oil of tranquility, is used as a stabilizing ingredient in perfumery to preserve more volatile fragrances.*

The goal of vetiver is to provide fluent tooling to **version**, **share**, **deploy**, and **monitor** a trained model. Functions handle both recording and checking the model's input data prototype, and predicting from a remote API endpoint.

## Data scientists have effective tools that they ‚ù§Ô∏è to:

-   collect data
-   prepare, manipulate, refine data
-   train models

:::{.callout-warning}
## There is a lack üò© of effective tools to:

-   put models into production
-   monitor model performance
-   trigger retraining
:::



You can use vetiver for deploying and handling your trained models.
