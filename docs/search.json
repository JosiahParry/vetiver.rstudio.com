This ptype is an automatically created Pydantic BaseModel that stores the types of the data that the API can expect when deployed. To enable this feature, set save_ptype = True and set ptype_data equal to training data. You can turn this feature off by setting save_ptype = False and not passing in any ptype_data."

    "text": "What are different ways you can contribute?\n\nAnswer questions\nYou can help others use and learn vetiver by answering questions on the RStudio community site, Stack Overflow, and Twitter. Many people asking for help with vetiver don‚Äôt know what a reproducible example or ‚Äúreprex‚Äù is, or how to craft one. Acknowledging an individual‚Äôs problem, showing them how to build a reprex, and pointing them to helpful resources are all enormously beneficial, even if you don‚Äôt immediately solve their problem.\nRemember that while you might have seen a problem a hundred times before, it‚Äôs new to the person asking it. Be patient, polite, and empathetic.\n\n\nFile issues\nIf you‚Äôve found a bug, first create a minimal reproducible example. Spend some time working to make it as minimal as possible; the more time you spend doing this, the easier it is to fix the bug. When your reprex is ready, file it on the GitHub repo of the appropriate package, either Python or R.\nThe vetiver team often focuses on one package at a time to reduce context switching and be more efficient. We may not address each issue right away, but we will use the reproducible example you create to understand your problem when it is time to focus on that package.\n\n\nContribute documentation\nDocumentation is a high priority for vetiver, and pull requests to correct or improve documentation are welcome.\n\n\nContribute code\nIf you are a more experienced R or Python programmer, you may have the inclination, interest, and ability to contribute directly to package development. Before you submit a pull request to vetiver, always file an issue and confirm the vetiver team agrees with your idea and is happy with your basic proposal.\nWe use the tidyverse style guide for R and the ??? style guide for Python. Using a style guide keeps your new code and documentation matching the existing style, and makes the review process much smoother."
